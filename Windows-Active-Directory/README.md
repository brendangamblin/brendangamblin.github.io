# Windows Active Directory

## üìå Overview
Built and Configured a Windows Active Directory domain on Windows Server 2022 to improve centralized management and DNS configuration in my homelab. This project sharpened my skills in setting up core services like AD DS and DNS, and prepared me for real-world IT support tasks involving user and network administration.

## üêû Troubleshooting & Issues
- **Issue:** The command to install the Active Directory Domain Service and DNS Roles was not recognized and would not execute. "Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services, DNS -IncludeManagementTools"
- **Diagnosis:** I researched and confirmed that the command is correct and should work to install these services.
- **Solution:** I executed the command to install AD DS with management tools first, then installed the DNS with management tools.
